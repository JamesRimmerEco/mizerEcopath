## Introduction

This package provides a framework for setting up and calibrating multi-species size spectrum models using the [mizer](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/) package. It offers tools to assist in translating empirical observations, such as species-specific biomass, consumption, and production rates, into steady-state models that are ecologically coherent.

The goal is to make the process of building, tuning, and validating mizer models more accessible, robust, and transparent.

These methods are designed to support applications ranging from academic research to exploratory ecosystem analysis and policy-relevant fisheries modelling.
