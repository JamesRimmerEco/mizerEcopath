\title{Set resource interaction to absorb external encounter rate}
\usage{
setResourceInteraction(params, resource_dynamics = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A mizer params object}

\item{resource_dynamics}{Optional. Character string specifying the resource dynamics to use. If NULL (default), does not change the current resource dynamics.}
}
\value{
The modified mizer params object with increased \code{interaction_resource}
species parameters and correspondingly decreased external encounter rate.
}
\description{
This function sets the resource interaction for each species to absorb as
much of the external encounter rate as possible. It adjusts the resource
capacity so that the resource can sustain the extra encounter without
changing the current resource abundance or the resource level.
}
\details{
If the initial abundances were at steady state, then they will remain at
steady state. This is because the total encounter rate is not modified by
this function and because the extra mortality on the resource is exactly
balanced by the changed resource capacity.

Optionally, you can specify the resource dynamics to use (e.g.,
"resource_semichemostat" or "resource_constant") by setting the
resource_dynamics argument. This allows you to switch between dynamic and
constant resource regimes directly through this function. For example:
params <- setResourceInteraction(params, resource_dynamics = "resource_semichemostat")
will set the resource dynamics to semichemostat.

Note: The function ensures that the resource level passed to setResource()
is strictly between 0 and 1, as required by mizer. If any value of
resource_level is greater than or equal to 1, it is set to just below 1
(0.99999999). If any value is less than or equal to 0, it is set to a small
positive value (1e-8). This prevents errors and ensures biological realism.
